Avalibility of system is depends on EC2 instance. 

**********************Instructions***************************

This system is implemented to present the overview. For the same reason, login and new user registration functionalities are resticted.

Upload the picture of a leaf from Images_to_upload folder to the system.

The saved machine learning model will provide accuracy concerning the three different types of diseases.

In the result section, the number shows the percentage match with that perticular class.

Highest number = Class belongs to the uploaded image.


********Procedure***********

1. Click on Upload images.

2. Upload image from provided folder.

3. Result will be displayed on dashboard.


********Information**************

The system for leaf disease detection is a cloud-based system using different machine learning techniques.

This system features a simple, robust, and user-friendly interface.

Also, the system is secure, with access restricted to authorized users and experts.

All the data is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) relational cloud database.
The dataset consists of more than 1000 images of leaves collected over the past several years.

Different machine learning models is trained by using dataset, which is used for the prediction of leaf disease.

This proposed system is faster, easy to use, and less expensive. Also, this system is highly scalable and accessible due to its cloud implementation.
